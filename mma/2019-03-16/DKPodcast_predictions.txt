Till shouldn't be as a good favorite, Till probably by decision, mostly pass on this fight
Nelson for the high score, Leon better chance to win
Sold on Reyes
Wood overvalued, odds off
Does not like Silva, Roberts much better striker, Silva has no cardio
Philips vs Marshman will not go distance, Philips awful
Could see getting behind Rinaldi, but not confident
Allen bad TD defense in previous, mostly avoid this fight
Diakese dog or pass
Safarov terrible knees
